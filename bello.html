           <div class="hl m-auto"></div>

           <div class="researchContainer">
            <p>Our project started with us identifying a proto-persona as a young woman interested in cosmetology as a hobby. We took that persona to search for similar potential users to interview. Asking research questions to identify key concerns of online learning, we discovered frequent pains and concerns users tend to have, as well as what they expect from learning beauty routines. We took this information and created an affinity diagram, empathy map, and then determined our typical user path for our site using Figjam.</p>

       <div class="container text-center research col-md-8">
        <h5>Definition</h5>
        <div class="hl m-auto"></div>

        <div class="definitionContainer">
         <p>Once our research was completed, we were able to begin addressing the main problems that online learners typically face, such as not being able to ask questions or follow along with the tutorials due to lack of tools and materials. As a team, we looked for solutions, creating a priotization matrix based on ideas meant to solve users pains. We also completed a competitors analysis of similar sites, like MasterClass, Aveda, and Paul Mitchell, to look at what sites were doing right and what they were doing wrong. We looked towards ideas we could implement into our site, and what things we should avoid that may be irritating to the users.</p>

        <h5>Ideation</h5>
        <div class="hl m-auto"></div>

        <div class="ideationContainer">
         <p>At this point, we completed a value proposition canvas based on our ideas to determine what was worth implementing and what was able to be put on the back-burner. Once our ideas were all in place of how we wanted the site to function, we were able to create a mind map of what should be featured on each page of the site. Then, it was time to determine what route our design would take. We knew we wanted something that felt simple and clean - so we took to Invision to create a mood board for our design. This is when we chose our monotone color-palette and the high-fashion feeling we wanted users to experience. </p>

    <div class="container text-center research col-md-8">
        <h5>Prototyping</h5>
        <div class="hl m-auto"></div>

        <div class="prototypingContainer">
         <p>As a team, we all created our own low fidelity models using Figma of how we think the site should look. Once we finished, we shared and explored each others designs and discussed what would work best, and what should be excluded. This is when we determined what our final design would look like. Filling out our high fidelity design on Figma was easy to do since we had already agreed upon our color palette and images with our mood board. We then just had to code the site using Visual Studio Code with HTML5 and CSS. Using Bootstrap allowed us to get our navigation and other general items in order quickly. </p>

        <h5>Testing</h5>
        <div class="hl m-auto"></div>

        <div class="testingContainer">
         <p>With our website completed and hosted on GitHub, it was time for us to conduct user testing. We had asked four users to complete three basic tasks on the site - logging in, finding one of our deals, and viewing the makeup tutorials. Luckily, all five users had success completing these objectives. Our users did provide us feedback about a few design changes we should made, such as putting a background color to our banner and making font sizes different. We looked through common feedback and made our design iterations based on what was commonly mentioned.</p>

        <h5>Outcome</h5>

        <div class="outcomeContainer">
         <p>With Bello completed, we felt like we had a great website made for all those interested in learning more about beauty. Our site is running and responsive, which taught us a lot about how UI developers work and what they need from designers. It also opened our eyes to how to work as a team, not just designing, but working together with coding - and being careful not to override each others iterations to the site. In the future we hope to add working videos, implement chatbots to help users with common questions, and a way for users to upload photos of their work to share with other users. </p>
