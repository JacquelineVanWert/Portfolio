                    <p>The all-in-one virtual teaching platform for teachers. </p>
                        <h4>Objective</h4>
                    <p>Virtual teachers have a lot on their plates and have to use multiple resources to plan and teach. With ULearn, teachers have a convienent all-in-one place to help them with all their classroom needs.</p>
                    <h4>Deliverables</h4>
                    <p>The deliverables neccessary included the Proto-Persona, Interview plan & transcripts, Affinity Diagram, Empathy Map, User Persona, User Insight, Problem Statement, Ideation, Feature Priotization Matrix, Value Proposition Canvas, Storyboard, Mind Map, Competitor Analysis, Digital Wireframes, User Tests, Iterations based on User Tests, and iOS Prototype.</p>

           <h5>Research</h5>
           <div class="hl m-auto"></div>

           <div class="researchContainer">
            <p>We started by creating a proto-persona to help us determine interview questions and our target audience. Once we completed 6 interviews with teachers and transcribed them, we completed an affinity diagram using Figjam to help visualize key things that stand out, such as the amount of resources that teachers currently use to plan lessons. Then, we created an empathy map to help further understand our users key pains and gains and further develop our teacher user-persona. </p>

       <div class="container text-center research">
        <h5>Definition</h5>
        <div class="hl m-auto"></div>

        <div class="definitionContainer">
         <p>Using our research we were able to identify the main problems that teachers face, such as having to use multiple platforms and apps to engage students in lessons, all while manging a classroom with tight time constraints. As a team we then decided that our solution for this was to create an all-in-one virtual teaching platform that teachers could use to prepare lessons in a quick and seamless way. We then decided to complete a competitor analysis of similar websites, such as Canvas, Nearpod, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams, that allowed us to discuss their features, strengths, and weaknesses and use that information to guide our ideation process. </p>

        <h5>Ideation</h5>
        <div class="hl m-auto"></div>

        <div class="ideationContainer">
         <p>Completing an "I like, I wish, What If" method of organizing ideas from our team helped us brainstorm ideas that could be used within the app. Using those ideas we created a feature priotization matrix, to see which ideas were integal to our creation - such as having a gradebook and creating lessons available right on the app. Our value proposition canvas allowed us to identify how those features would help users current pains with preparing lessons and what users would gain from using our app. We then created a storyboard, with a drawn out idea of how our users would find value in our app after dealing with the frustrations of online teaching. </p>

    <div class="container text-center research">
        <h5>Prototyping</h5>
        <div class="hl m-auto"></div>

        <div class="prototypingContainer">
         <p>Before creating our actual prototypes, we started first with a mind-map to help our team visualize what would be covered in each area of our navigation, and how we would cohesively design it. We then created a Figma file that allowed us to build out wireframes of each section and put in the interactions that users would use in order to sign into the app, create a lesson, and review the gradebook.  </p>

    <div class="container text-center research">
        <h5>Testing</h5>
        <div class="hl m-auto"></div>

        <div class="testingContainer">
         <p>We completed two recorded user tests with teachers that had them complete tasks such as creating a new teacher account, creating a new science lesson with videos and games, and sending parents a grade notification for their students. Using the data we gathered from those tests, we added in certain features to help including a back button on every page, signing up for a new account bringing you straight to the home page, and turning student grades and participation records from multiple pages into one expanded list. </p>

    <div class="container text-center research">
        <h5>Outcome</h5>
        <div class="hl m-auto"></div>

        <div class="outcomeContainer">
         <p>By completing this project, we discovered that utilizing tablets as our main platform we came across difficulties in knowing how to use space effectively without it becoming overwhelming. With more iterations, this app would be constantly evolving to keep up with teacher needs. For our next steps, we will create a hi-fi prototype with the ability to access cloud saved lessons by all teachers. We would also finish building out our calendar and the “My Classes” tab to show student information for each class. In the future, we would hope to be able to build out the sister apps of having a student version and school version of ULearn.
